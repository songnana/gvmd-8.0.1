/**

 * @brief The Greenbone Vulnerability Manager GMP daemon.
 *
 * This file defines the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager daemon.  The Manager
 * serves the Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP) to clients such as the
 * Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA). The Manager and GMP give clients full
 * access to an OpenVAS Scanner.
 *
 * The library provides two functions: \ref init_gmpd and \ref serve_gmp.
 * \ref init_gmpd initialises the daemon.
 * \ref serve_gmp serves GMP to a single client socket until end of file is
 * reached on the socket.
